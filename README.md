# Api Key Manager

Api Key Manager is a CLI Application that saves our API Keys. For the Database I have choosen MariaDB for the Database.

I maked this project because for me and some friends was so complicated save our all API Keys but you must think, hey you can save it in some notes application or something like that, yeah it is an option to do this, I did it but for us it was very slow and annoying to open an application just to check our API keys instead that with this CLI We can see our all API KEYS with just one command. 

## Installaling Dependencies and Config the AppðŸš€

### Installation ðŸ”§

#### Install dependencies
1. First you will have to execute the **bash script**.
    This script will install all dependencies and configurate all for you
    ```
    #with virtual enviroment
    sh install_dependencies.sh

    #withouth virtual enviroment
    sh install_dependencies_withouth_venv.sh
    ```

2. Make a **database** for the storage
3. Make a file **.env** for the enviroment variables **you will have create .env in the root of the application**

### Config app

3. run the application
    
    ```

    ```

### Create a alias
#### Linux users
Yes, we will create an alias because without this it would be very annoying to go to the folder where the application is located.
The alias We will permitted execute the app in anywhere of system.

1. ```
   $ cd ~
   ```

2. search a file **.bashrc or .zshrc**
    
    ```
    $ ls -a
    ```

3. Edit File
    **if you use zsh terminal set nvim .zshrc**
    **if you don't have neovim, use nano or other code editor**
    
    ```
    $ nvim .bashrc
    ```

4. Go to end of the file and set. **You can change the name of the alias**

    ```
    alias cli_api="python3 /home/gonzalo/Documentos/Workspace_Dev/Proyectos/Python/CLI/Api-Key-Manager-CLI/app/__init__.py
    ```

5. Close your terminal
6. Open your terminal and **set the alias name**

    ```
    $ cli_api
    ```

## Other usages
The principal function of this app is save the API KEYs but **if you change somethings in the prints of __init__.py and db.py you can use this app for anything**
